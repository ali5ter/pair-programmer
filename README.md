# Pair Programmer

**Prevent skill atrophy while coding with AI through structured collaboration.**

## The Problem

AI code generation creates deceptive productivity. You ship features faster while your problem-solving muscles atrophy. As MIT professor Roberto Rigobon warns about AI dependency: "When we stop using our brains... we forget."

"Vibe coding" - passively accepting AI-generated code - feels productive but degrades the skills that make you valuable: debugging, architecture decisions, performance intuition, and deep understanding of your codebase.

## The Solution

A graduated assistance framework that maintains cognitive load while leveraging AI as a force multiplier. Think of it as weight training: you need resistance to build strength.

## Four Levels of Assistance

### Level 1: Pure Architecture

**AI advises, you code everything.**

Use when learning new patterns or maintaining sharp skills.

```text
You: "Should I use event delegation for these dynamic elements?"
AI: "Event delegation works well here because..."
You: [writes all the code]
AI: [reviews and suggests improvements]
```

**Best for:**

- Learning new technologies
- Critical algorithm implementation
- Maintaining coding skills
- Deep architectural decisions

### Level 2: Scaffolding

**AI provides structure, you implement logic.**

AI creates interfaces, type definitions, file structure. You write the actual logic and business rules.

```text
AI: [generates class skeleton with method signatures]
You: [implements method bodies]
```

**Best for:**

- New feature development
- Refactoring with clear requirements
- Projects with well-defined interfaces
- When you want structure but need to understand implementation

### Level 3: Pair Programming

**Collaborative alternation with mandatory engagement.**

Alternate function-by-function. You must modify or improve AI code before moving on - no passive copying.

```text
You: [writes authentication function]
AI: [writes validation function]
You: [modifies AI code, then writes next function]
```

**Best for:**

- Large feature development
- Balanced learning and velocity
- Complex implementations requiring back-and-forth
- When you want to see alternative approaches

### Level 4: Full Generation

**AI writes complete implementations. Use sparingly.**

Reserve for boilerplate, well-solved problems, or time-critical situations. **Mandatory explain-back**: you must explain every line before using it.

```text
You: "Generate OAuth2 boilerplate for GitHub login"
AI: [provides complete implementation]
You: [explains back how every part works]
```

**Best for:**

- Standard boilerplate (config files, build scripts)
- Well-solved problems (date formatting, common algorithms)
- Time-critical production issues
- Code you've written 100 times before

## Warning Signs of Dependency

Stop and reassess if you notice:

- Can't explain how AI-generated code works
- Copying code without modification
- Uncomfortable coding without AI available
- Reaching for AI before attempting yourself
- Debugging by asking AI instead of using tools
- Can't remember how to solve problems you "solved" yesterday

## Active Learning Techniques

### 1. Explain-Back Protocol

After AI provides anything, explain it back in your own words. If you can't, you don't understand it.

### 2. Modification Requirement

Change something in AI code before using it - variable names, structure, approach. Forces active engagement.

### 3. Implementation Comparison

Code it yourself first, then compare with AI approach. Learn from differences.

### 4. Constraint Exercises

"Help me solve X but don't write code, only describe the approach." Forces you to do the implementation.

## Session Declaration Pattern

Start each session by declaring your level:

```bash
# Level 1 example
"Level 1: I want to implement this authentication flow myself.
Just advise on security considerations and API choices."

# Level 2 example
"Level 2: Give me class structure for a chatbot framework.
I'll implement all the methods."

# Level 3 example
"Level 3: Let's alternate on this feature. I'll write the data
layer, you write the API, I'll modify and write the UI."

# Level 4 example
"Level 4: Generate OAuth2 boilerplate - I've done this 20 times
and just need the standard pattern."
```

## Installation

```bash
./install
```

Installs the agent to `~/.claude/agents/pair-programmer.md` and integrates with Claude Code CLI.

## Usage

### Verify Installation

Check that the agent installed successfully:

```bash
ls -l ~/.claude/agents/
```

You should see `pair-programmer.md` listed.

### Starting a Session

Launch Claude Code with the pair-programmer agent:

```bash
claude --agent pair-programmer
```

### Declaring Your Level

Start your first message by declaring your assistance level:

```bash
# Level 1: Pure architecture/advisory
claude --agent pair-programmer
> Level 1: I want to implement a rate limiter myself.
> Just advise on algorithm choices.

# Level 2: Scaffolding
claude --agent pair-programmer
> Level 2: Scaffold an API client class for GitHub.
> I'll implement the request methods.

# Level 3: Pair programming
claude --agent pair-programmer
> Level 3: Let's alternate building a CLI tool.
> I'll start with argument parsing.

# Level 4: Full generation (sparingly)
claude --agent pair-programmer
> Level 4: Generate standard Express middleware boilerplate.
```

### Switching Agents

Return to default Claude Code (no agent):

```bash
claude
```

List available agents:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Mid-Session Level Changes

You can change levels during a session:

```
"Let's switch to Level 2 for this next feature."
```

The agent will confirm the change and reset state tracking.

### Session Tips

- **Be explicit** about your level at the start
- **Modify AI code** in Level 3 to demonstrate understanding
- **Explain back** in Level 4 before moving to next task
- **Use Level 1** when learning new patterns or maintaining sharp skills
- **Reserve Level 4** for true boilerplate and time-sensitive situations

## Philosophy

This framework is built on several principles:

**Cognitive load is necessary.** If coding feels effortless, you're probably atrophying. Good collaboration should be mentally demanding.

**Understanding > Shipping.** Better to ship slightly slower while maintaining deep knowledge of your codebase than to become a prompt engineer who can't debug their own code.

**AI as a tool, not a replacement.** Use AI like you use a debugger, profiler, or code review - as a specialist that augments your capabilities, not replaces your thinking.

**Graduated resistance training.** Choose the level that maintains appropriate challenge. Too easy and you atrophy; too hard and you burn out.

*Remember: The goal isn't to avoid AI. It's to use AI in a way that makes you stronger, not weaker.*
